      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 04/12/2024</p>

      <p>
        <strong>EduGrades</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") values your privacy
        and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy
        Policy explains how we collect, use, and store your data when you use
        the EduGrades application (the "App").
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect the following personal information to ensure proper
        functionality of the App:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>First name and last name</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The App is designed for users of all ages, including minors. By using
        the App, you consent to the collection of this data.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        The information collected is used solely for
        <strong>authentication purposes</strong>, allowing users to securely
        access and interact with the App. We do not use your personal
        information for marketing or share it for unrelated purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Storage of Information</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is securely stored in <strong>Firebase</strong>, a cloud-based
        service provided by Google. Data is retained in our system until the
        user decides to modify or delete their information.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share your personal information with third parties except:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When required by law or to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li>
          As part of Firebase's data processing services. You can review
          Firebase's privacy policy
          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information
        against unauthorized access or misuse. While we strive to ensure the
        security of your data, no system can guarantee absolute protection.
        Examples of implemented measures include encrypted data transfers and
        access control mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        As a user of EduGrades, you have the following rights concerning your
        personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Modification:</strong> You can update your last name, first
          name, password directly within the App. You can ask to change your
          email address or phone number by sending an email to
          <a href="mailto:cutiips.dev@gmail.com">cutiips.dev@gmail.com</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion:</strong> Currently, the App does not support
          self-service data deletion. However, users can request to delete their
          data by sending an email to
          <a href="mailto:cutiips.dev@gmail.com">cutiips.dev@gmail.com</a>. This
          process will be handled manually until a self-service option is
          implemented in a future update.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        EduGrades takes the privacy of minors seriously. We encourage parents
        and guardians to supervise their children's use of the App. If you
        believe we have collected personal data from a minor without parental
        consent, please contact us immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted in the App, and the updated policy will take effect from the date
        of posting. We encourage users to regularly review this policy to stay
        informed about how we handle their data.
      </p>
